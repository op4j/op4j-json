- ToJsonString ok
- ToObject ok
- ToObjectsCollection ok
- ToObjectsList|Array ???



- Tests toJsonString with jsonConfig
- Have a look at how Date objects are being converted into json string
(using DATE_PATTERN = "yyyyMMdd G HHmmss Z"; ??)



Notes:
- When executing test9 from ToObjectsCollectionTest, ABean is
created for every object inside objectCollection though properties
do not match --> It does not fail...buy shows a warning message
- Check how to configure how inner objects are being converted....use different types instead
of always ABean as in test9
